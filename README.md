"DOMAIN": SOFTWARE TESTING

"DURATION": 4 Weeks

"MENTOR": NEELA SANTHOSH


## Objective

The objective of this project is to perform functional testing of RESTful APIs using Postman. Specifically, the project focuses on:
-Testing Authentication APIs to ensure successful login and token generation.
-Testing Data Retrieval APIs to verify that user data can be correctly fetched.
The deliverables include a Postman collection containing all tested APIs and a comprehensive test execution report documenting the test steps, expected and actual results, and pass/fail status. This ensures that API functionalities are validated and documented in a professional manner for submission.

## Description
This project tests RESTful APIs using Postman for authentication and data retrieval functionalities.
This project focuses on testing RESTful APIs using Postman to verify authentication and data retrieval functionalities. The APIs are tested to ensure correct request handling, valid responses, and successful data exchange between client and server. Test results are documented to demonstrate proper API behavior.


## APIs Tested
1. Login API (Authentication)
2. Get Users API (Data Retrieval)

## Tools Used
- Postman

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates RESTful API testing using Postman, focusing on:
- Authentication testing
- Data retrieval testing  

The goal is to validate API functionality and document the test execution results.


## Conclusion
In this project, RESTful APIs were successfully tested using Postman for both authentication and data retrieval functionalities. The Login API verified that authentication tokens are generated correctly, while the Get Users API confirmed that user data can be retrieved as expected. All test cases passed, and the results were documented in a clear and organized test execution report. The Postman collection and report provide a complete and professional demonstration of API testing, ensuring the project meets CODTECH’s Task-2 requirements.
